TEST FILE FOR REFACTORING VALIDATION
====================================

This test file validates that the service layer produces identical results
to the direct run_risk.py function calls. It serves as the primary validation
tool during the refactoring process.

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FOR REFACTORING SUCCESS:
- This test MUST pass (9/9 tests) after each extraction step
- If ANY test fails, the refactoring step must be reverted and fixed
- The specific metrics below must remain unchanged throughout refactoring

âœ… EXPECTED METRICS (must remain identical):
- Portfolio volatility: 19.80%
- Performance returns: 25.98%  
- Sharpe ratio: 1.180
- Risk score: 100 (Excellent)
- Min variance optimization: Working correctly
- Stock analysis (SGOV): Completed successfully
- AI interpretation: ~5,265 characters
- Data loading: All 14 tickers loaded
- Cache functionality: Hit/miss working

ðŸ§ª TESTING STRATEGY:
1. Run this test after each extraction step
2. Compare service layer results vs direct function calls
3. Verify structured data consistency
4. Check performance metrics haven't changed
5. Validate caching behavior is preserved

This test provides confidence that refactoring preserves all functionality.
