## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Financial Modeling Prep API key

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/henrysouchien/risk_module.git
   cd risk_module
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy statsmodels requests python-dotenv pyarrow streamlit pyyaml flask flask-limiter redis
   ```

3. **Configure API key**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   FMP_API_KEY=your_fmp_api_key_here
   ```

## üìñ Usage

### Portfolio Analysis

Run a complete portfolio risk analysis:

```bash
python run_portfolio_risk.py
```

This will:
- Load portfolio configuration from `portfolio.yaml`
- Fetch market data for all securities
- Perform multi-factor regression analysis
- Calculate portfolio risk metrics
- Generate comprehensive risk report

### Single Stock Analysis

Analyze individual stock risk profile:

```bash
python run_single_stock_profile.py
```

### Configuration

#### Default Settings (`settings.py`)

Centralized default configuration for the risk module:

```python
PORTFOLIO_DEFAULTS = {
    "start_date": "2019-01-31",
    "end_date": "2025-06-27"
}
```

These defaults are used when specific dates aren't provided in portfolio configurations.

#### Date Logic and Calculation Windows

The risk module uses a consistent date system across all calculations:

**Primary Portfolio System:**
- **Source**: Dates are read from `portfolio.yaml` (`start_date` and `end_date`)
- **Usage**: All portfolio risk calculations, factor regressions, and optimizations use this window
- **Consistency**: Ensures all calculations use the same historical period for accurate comparisons

**Fallback System:**
- **Default**: `PORTFOLIO_DEFAULTS` from `settings.py` when portfolio dates aren't specified
- **Proxy Generation**: GPT peer generation and validation use portfolio dates for consistency
- **Data Quality**: Peer filtering ensures all tickers have sufficient observations within the date window

**Independent Analysis:**
- **Single Stock**: `run_stock()` uses flexible dates (5-year default or explicit parameters)
- **Historical Analysis**: `calc_max_factor_betas()` uses 10-year lookback for worst-case scenarios
- **Purpose**: These functions serve different use cases and appropriately use different date logic

**Calculation Alignment:**
- All factor calculations (market, momentum, value, industry) use the same date window
- Peer median returns are calculated over the same period as the target ticker
- Regression windows are consistent across all securities in the portfolio
- Data quality validation ensures stable factor betas by preventing insufficient observation windows

#### Portfolio Configuration (`portfolio.yaml`)

```yaml
start_date: "2019-05-31"
end_date: "2024-03-31"

portfolio_input:
  TW:   {weight: 0.15}
  MSCI: {weight: 0.15}
  NVDA: {weight: 0.17}
  # ... more positions

expected_returns:
  TW: 0.15
  MSCI: 0.16
  # ... expected returns for each position

stock_factor_proxies:
  TW:
    market: SPY
    momentum: MTUM
    value: IWD
    industry: KCE
    subindustry: [TW, MSCI, NVDA]
  # ... factor proxies for each position
```

#### Risk Limits (`risk_limits.yaml`)

```yaml
portfolio_limits:
  max_volatility: 0.40
  max_loss: -0.25

concentration_limits:
  max_single_stock_weight: 0.40

variance_limits:
  max_factor_contribution: 0.30
  max_market_contribution: 0.30
  max_industry_contribution: 0.30
```

## üìà Output Examples

### Portfolio Risk Summary

The system generates actionable risk insights including:

- **Volatility Analysis**: Understand your portfolio's risk level to make informed allocation decisions
- **Factor Exposures**: See your market bets to decide if you want to hedge or adjust exposures
- **Risk Decomposition**: Identify what's driving your risk to focus your management efforts
- **Concentration Analysis**: Check your diversification to decide if you need more positions
- **Risk Limit Monitoring**: Stay within your comfort zone to avoid unpleasant surprises

### Single Stock Profile

Individual stock analysis helps you make better buy/sell decisions by providing:

- **Factor Regression**: Understand how market forces affect this stock to make informed decisions
- **Risk Metrics**: See the stock's risk profile to decide if it fits your portfolio
- **Factor Contributions**: Identify what's driving the stock's performance to assess its role
- **Peer Comparison**: Compare against similar stocks to make better relative value decisions

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Factor Models

You can customize factor models by modifying the `stock_factor_proxies` section in `portfolio.yaml`:

```yaml
stock_factor_proxies:
  YOUR_STOCK:
    market: SPY          # Market factor proxy
    momentum: MTUM       # Momentum factor proxy
    value: IWD          # Value factor proxy
    industry: KCE       # Industry factor proxy
    subindustry: [PEER1, PEER2, PEER3]  # Sub-industry peers
```

### Data Quality Validation

The system includes robust data quality validation to ensure you get reliable insights for confident decision-making:

- **Individual Ticker Validation**: Ensures each stock has enough data for accurate risk assessment
- **Peer Group Validation**: Prevents unreliable comparisons that could lead to bad decisions
- **Automatic Filtering**: Removes problematic data so you can trust the analysis
- **Stable Factor Betas**: Ensures risk metrics are reliable for making allocation decisions

This validation ensures that your risk analysis is trustworthy, so you can make decisions with confidence.

### Risk Limit Customization

Set your risk tolerance in `risk_limits.yaml` to get alerts when your portfolio exceeds your comfort zone:

```yaml
portfolio_limits:
  max_volatility: 0.35    # Maximum portfolio volatility you're comfortable with
  max_loss: -0.20         # Maximum loss you can tolerate

concentration_limits:
  max_single_stock_weight: 0.25  # Maximum single position size for diversification
```

**Purpose**: Shows which positions are driving your portfolio's risk, helping you decide which stocks to reduce if you need to lower overall risk.

**Herfindahl Index (Concentration)**
```
H = Œ£(w_i¬≤)
```
*Function: `compute_herfindahl()`*
**Purpose**: Measures how diversified your portfolio is, helping you decide if you're over-concentrated in too few positions and need to add more holdings.

### Factor Analysis

**Factor Beta**
```
Œ≤_i,f = Cov(r_i, r_f) / Var(r_f)
```
*Function: `compute_stock_factor_betas()`*
**Purpose**: Shows how sensitive your stocks are to market forces (like tech sector moves or value vs growth trends), helping you understand if you're taking unintended bets.

**Portfolio Factor Beta**
```
Œ≤_p,f = Œ£(w_i √ó Œ≤_i,f)
```
*Function: `build_portfolio_view()`*
**Purpose**: Shows your overall exposure to market factors, helping you decide if you want to hedge certain exposures or if you're comfortable with your current market bets.

**Excess Return**
```
r_excess = r_etf - r_market
```
*Function: `fetch_excess_return()`*
**Purpose**: Measures how much a factor (like momentum or value) moves independently of the market, helping you understand if you're getting compensated for taking factor-specific risk.

### Variance Decomposition

**Total Portfolio Variance**
```
œÉ¬≤_p = œÉ¬≤_factor + œÉ¬≤_idiosyncratic
```
**Purpose**: Breaks down your portfolio's risk into what you can control (stock selection) vs. what you can't (market factors), helping you focus your risk management efforts.

**Factor Variance**
```
œÉ¬≤_factor = Œ£(w_i¬≤ √ó Œ≤_i,f¬≤ √ó œÉ_f¬≤)
```
*Function: `compute_portfolio_variance_breakdown()`*
**Purpose**: Shows how much of your risk comes from market factors you can't control, helping you decide if you need to hedge or if you're comfortable with systematic risk exposure.

**Idiosyncratic Variance**
```
œÉ¬≤_idio = Œ£(w_i¬≤ √ó œÉ¬≤_idio,i)
```
**Purpose**: Shows how much of your risk comes from individual stock choices, helping you decide if you need more diversification or if your stock selection is adding value.

**Euler Variance Contribution**
```
VC_i = w_i √ó (Œ£w)_i / Œ£(w_i √ó (Œ£w)_i)
```
*Function: `compute_euler_variance_percent()`*
**Purpose**: Shows which positions contribute most to your portfolio's ups and downs, helping you identify where to focus your risk management efforts.

### Volatility Calculations

**Annualized Volatility**
```
œÉ_annual = œÉ_monthly √ó ‚àö12
```
*Function: `compute_volatility()`*
Monthly volatility scaled to annual basis using square root of time rule.

**Monthly Returns**
```
r_t = (P_t - P_{t-1}) / P_{t-1}
```
*Function: `calc_monthly_returns()`*
Percentage change in price from one month-end to the next.

### Optimization Constraints

**Portfolio Variance Constraint**
```
w^T Œ£ w ‚â§ œÉ_max¬≤
```
Maximum allowable portfolio volatility constraint for risk management.

**Factor Beta Constraint**
```
|Œ£(w_i √ó Œ≤_i,f)| ‚â§ Œ≤_max,f
```
**Purpose**: Limits your exposure to market factors to prevent taking too much systematic risk.

**Weight Constraint**
```
0 ‚â§ w_i ‚â§ w_max
```
**Purpose**: Prevents over-concentration in single positions to maintain proper diversification.
