**Risk Score Interpretation:**
The risk score measures "disruption risk" - how likely your portfolio is to exceed your maximum acceptable loss in various failure scenarios.

- **90-100 (Excellent)**: Very low disruption risk - all potential losses well within limits
- **80-89 (Good)**: Acceptable disruption risk - minor risk management improvements recommended
- **70-79 (Fair)**: Moderate disruption risk - some potential losses exceed limits, improvements needed
- **60-69 (Poor)**: High disruption risk - multiple losses exceed limits, significant action required
- **0-59 (Very Poor)**: Portfolio needs immediate restructuring to avoid unacceptable losses

**Component Scores:**
- **Factor Risk (35%)**: Market/value/momentum exposure vs. historical worst losses
- **Concentration Risk (30%)**: Position sizes and diversification vs. single-stock failure scenarios
- **Volatility Risk (20%)**: Portfolio volatility level vs. maximum reasonable volatility
- **Sector Risk (15%)**: Sector concentration vs. historical sector crashes

# Set up factor proxies (required for new portfolios)
inject_all_proxies(use_gpt_subindustry=True)
```

### Configuration

#### Default Settings (`settings.py`)

Centralized default configuration for the risk module:

```python
PORTFOLIO_DEFAULTS = {
    "start_date": "2019-01-31",
    "end_date": "2025-06-27"
}
```

These defaults are used when specific dates aren't provided in portfolio configurations.

#### Date Logic and Calculation Windows

The risk module uses a consistent date system across all calculations:

**Primary Portfolio System:**
- **Source**: Dates are read from `portfolio.yaml` (`start_date` and `end_date`)
- **Usage**: All portfolio risk calculations, factor regressions, and optimizations use this window
- **Consistency**: Ensures all calculations use the same historical period for accurate comparisons

**Fallback System:**
- **Default**: `PORTFOLIO_DEFAULTS` from `settings.py` when portfolio dates aren't specified
- **Proxy Generation**: GPT peer generation and validation use portfolio dates for consistency
- **Data Quality**: Peer filtering ensures all tickers have sufficient observations within the date window

**Independent Analysis:**
- **Single Stock**: `run_stock()` uses flexible dates (5-year default or explicit parameters)
- **Historical Analysis**: `calc_max_factor_betas()` uses 10-year lookback for worst-case scenarios
- **Purpose**: These functions serve different use cases and appropriately use different date logic

**Calculation Alignment:**
- All factor calculations (market, momentum, value, industry) use the same date window
- Peer median returns are calculated over the same period as the target ticker
- Regression windows are consistent across all securities in the portfolio
- Data quality validation ensures stable factor betas by preventing insufficient observation windows

#### Portfolio Configuration (`portfolio.yaml`)

```yaml
start_date: "2019-05-31"
end_date: "2024-03-31"

portfolio_input:
  TW:   {weight: 0.15}
  MSCI: {weight: 0.15}
  NVDA: {weight: 0.17}
  # ... more positions

expected_returns:
  TW: 0.15
  MSCI: 0.16
  # ... expected returns for each position

stock_factor_proxies:
  TW:
    market: SPY
    momentum: MTUM
    value: IWD
    industry: KCE
    subindustry: [TW, MSCI, NVDA]
  # ... factor proxies for each position
```

#### Risk Limits (`risk_limits.yaml`)

```yaml
portfolio_limits:
  max_volatility: 0.40
  max_loss: -0.25

concentration_limits:
  max_single_stock_weight: 0.40

variance_limits:
  max_factor_contribution: 0.30
  max_market_contribution: 0.30
  max_industry_contribution: 0.30
```

This validation ensures that your risk analysis is trustworthy, so you can make decisions with confidence.

### Risk Limit Customization

Set your risk tolerance in `risk_limits.yaml` to get alerts when your portfolio exceeds your comfort zone:

```yaml
portfolio_limits:
  max_volatility: 0.35    # Maximum portfolio volatility you're comfortable with
  max_loss: -0.20         # Maximum loss you can tolerate

concentration_limits:
  max_single_stock_weight: 0.25  # Maximum single position size for diversification
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management Framework

### Risk Limits Framework

The risk management system uses a comprehensive framework of limits designed to control portfolio risk across multiple dimensions. These limits are based on fundamental risk management principles and protect against various types of portfolio losses.

#### Core Risk Limit Categories

**1. Overall Portfolio Risk Limits**

- **Volatility Limit (40%)**: Control total portfolio risk and align with risk tolerance
- **Loss Limit (-25%)**: Set maximum acceptable portfolio loss and define risk budget

**2. Concentration Risk Limits**

- **Single-Stock Weight Limit (40%)**: "Limit risk from errors" - prevent single-stock blowups
- **Herfindahl Index Monitoring**: Measure portfolio concentration (target: < 0.15)

**3. Factor Risk Exposure Limits**

- **Factor Variance Contribution (30%)**: Control systematic risk exposure
- **Market Variance Contribution (50%)**: Control market beta exposure
- **Industry Variance Contribution (30%)**: Prevent sector concentration

**4. Factor Beta Limits**

- **Market Beta Limit (0.77)**: Derived from loss limit √∑ worst market loss
- **Momentum Beta Limit (0.79)**: Control momentum factor exposure
- **Value Beta Limit (0.55)**: Control value factor exposure
- **Industry Beta Limits (Varies)**: Each industry has different volatility characteristics

#### Risk Limit Setting Process

1. **Define Risk Tolerance**: Set maximum acceptable portfolio loss and volatility tolerance
2. **Calculate Factor Limits**: Analyze historical factor performance and derive beta limits
3. **Set Variance Limits**: Determine acceptable systematic risk exposure
4. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review limit breaches and adjust as needed

#### Interpreting Limit Breaches

- **PASS**: Portfolio meets risk limit
- **FAIL**: Portfolio exceeds risk limit, action required
- **Risk Score Impact**: Limit breaches reduce overall risk score
- **Action Recommendations**: Specific guidance for each type of breach

### Risk Scoring Framework

The portfolio risk score provides a comprehensive 0-100 rating that evaluates portfolio risk across multiple dimensions. Similar to a credit score, it combines various risk metrics into a single actionable number with clear categories and recommendations.

#### Risk Score Components

The risk score is calculated using four main components:

1. **Portfolio Volatility (30% weight)**: Based on actual volatility vs. limit
2. **Concentration Risk (20% weight)**: Based on max weight and Herfindahl Index
3. **Factor Exposure Risk (25% weight)**: Average score across all factor betas
4. **Systematic Risk (25% weight)**: Based on factor variance contribution vs. limit

#### Risk Score Categories

| Score Range | Category | Description | Action Required |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **90-100** | **Excellent** | Very low risk portfolio | Monitor and maintain |
| **80-89** | **Good** | Low risk portfolio | Minor adjustments may be needed |
| **70-79** | **Fair** | Moderate risk portfolio | Consider risk reduction |
| **60-69** | **Poor** | High risk portfolio | Significant action recommended |
| **0-59** | **Very Poor** | Very high risk portfolio | Immediate action required |

#### Scoring Methodology

**Portfolio Volatility Score (30%)**
- Score 100: Volatility ‚â§ 50% of limit (very low risk)
- Score 80: Volatility ‚â§ 75% of limit (low risk)
- Score 60: Volatility ‚â§ 90% of limit (moderate risk)
- Score 40: Volatility ‚â§ 100% of limit (high risk)
- Score 0: Volatility > limit (over limit)

**Concentration Risk Score (20%)**
- **Max Weight Component**: Based on largest position vs. limit
- **Herfindahl Index Component**: Score = max(0, 100 - (HHI √ó 100))
- **Combined Score**: Weighted average with bonus for good concentration

**Factor Exposure Risk Score (25%)**
- **Calculation**: Average score across all factor betas
- **Factors Evaluated**: Market, momentum, value, and industry betas
- **Scoring**: Based on beta vs. respective limits

**Systematic Risk Score (25%)**
- **Calculation**: Based on factor variance contribution vs. limit
- **Linear Penalty**: For exceeding limits using formula: `max(0, 40 - 80 √ó (factor_var_ratio - 1.0))`

#### Action Recommendations

**For Poor/Very Poor Scores (0-69)**
- Identify primary risk factors from score breakdown
- Reduce largest positions if concentration is high
- Add defensive positions if volatility is high
- Diversify sectors if systematic risk is high
- Consider portfolio optimization (min variance or max return)

**For Fair Scores (70-79)**
- Target specific weaknesses from component scores
- Gradual position adjustments (don't make dramatic changes)
- Add diversification with new positions in different sectors
- Review risk tolerance to ensure limits match strategy

**For Good/Excellent Scores (80-100)**
- Regular monitoring and monthly reviews
- Rebalancing to maintain target weights
- Risk limit review to ensure limits remain appropriate
- Performance tracking to ensure risk-adjusted returns

#### Integration with Portfolio Management

- **Risk Score Updates**: Monthly or after significant changes
- **Decision Making**: Use risk score to guide new positions, sizing, and rebalancing
- **Reporting**: Include risk score and breakdown in client reports and management reviews
- **Customization**: Adjust component weights and thresholds for different strategies

### Factor Proxy Configuration

**Industry Mapping (`industry_to_etf.yaml`):**
```yaml
"Technology": "XLK"
"Healthcare": "XLV"
"Financial Services": "XLF"
# ... more industry mappings
```

**Exchange-Specific Proxies (`exchange_etf_proxies.yaml`):**
```yaml
NASDAQ:
  market: "SPY"
  momentum: "MTUM"
  value: "IWD"
DEFAULT:
  market: "ACWX"
  momentum: "IMTM"
  value: "EFV"
```

## üß™ Testing

The system includes several ways to test your portfolio analysis:

```python
from run_risk import run_portfolio, run_portfolio_performance, run_stock, run_what_if, run_min_variance, run_max_return
from portfolio_risk_score import portfolio_risk_score

# 1. Full portfolio analysis
run_portfolio()

# 2. Portfolio performance analysis
run_portfolio_performance("portfolio.yaml")

# 3. Single stock analysis
run_stock("AAPL")

# 4. What-if scenario testing
changes = {"AAPL": 0.05, "SGOV": 0.10}  # Reduce AAPL, add SGOV
run_what_if(changes)

# 5. Portfolio optimization
run_min_variance()  # Minimum risk portfolio
run_max_return()    # Maximum return portfolio

# 6. Risk scoring
score, breakdown, recommendations = portfolio_risk_score()
```

Each provides actionable insights to help you make better investment decisions.
